# Wordle Helper
A template to copy to make a react project for github pages

## Web Quick Start

Visit the [web page located on github pages](https://keeganw.github.io/wordle-helper/). This is running from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Development Setup

1. Install Node and NPM for your OS using [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or brew on Mac (`brew install node`)
1. In the root directory of the cloned project, run `npm install`
1. Once it is done, you can start the development server with `npm start`. If a web page is not automatically opened, go to [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Using the Tool


## Pushing Changes to Github Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Using react's `gh-pages` you can simply run the above command to deploy to the github page.
